<br>
**Visualize the Graph**

GraphViz should be accessible at host:7007/ui

The principal points of entry for the GraphViz application are the query editor and the graph lists.
When you start GraphViz, the graph list will be populated with the graphs loaded in the graph server. To run queries against a graph, select that graph. The query lets you write PGQL queries that can be visualized. (PGQL is the SQL-like query language supported by GraphViz.)

Once the query is ready and the desired graph is selected, click Run to execute the query.

**Publish the oe sample graph**
