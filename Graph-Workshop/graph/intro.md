## Introduction to Oracle Graph ##

Oracle’s converged, multi-model database natively supports graphs and delivers high performance, scalable graph data management, query, and analytics for enterprise applications. State-of-the-art graph features are available along with functionality required for enterprise grade applications: fine-grained security, high availability, easy manageability, and integration with other data in an application.

Oracle’s mission is to help people see data in new ways, discover insights, and unlock endless possibilities.  Graph analysis is about understanding relationships and connections in data, and detecting patterns that identify new insights. With Oracle’s Graph offerings developers can use a comprehensive suite of graph query and analytics tools to integrate graphs into applications on enterprise grade data management infrastructure.

For example, graph algorithms can identify what individual or item is most connected to others in social networks or business processes.   They can identify communities, anomalies, common patterns, and paths that connect individuals or related transactions.  Every Oracle Database now includes both property graph and RDF graph data models as well as algorithms, query languages, and visualization tools.

Property Graph database includes:

•	PGX in-memory graph engine

•	PGQL graph query language

•	50+ Graph algorithms

•	Support for graph visualization 


Customers use Property Graphs in fraud analytics, vulnerability analysis, recommendation systems, and more.

RDF Graph database includes:

•	SPARQL graph query language

•	Java APIs via open source Apache Jena 

•	W3C standards support for semantic data, ontologies and inferencing

•	RDF Graph views of relational tables

Customers use RDF Graphs in linked data and data sharing applications in pharma, publishing, public sector and more.
This workbook provides an overview of Oracle Graph support for property graph features.
